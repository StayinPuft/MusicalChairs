# MusicalChairs
A version of Musical Chairs for Launchpad S. Made in Unity3D. 
To run, you first need to run the proper MidiBridge executable so the LaunchPad S can communicate properly with Unity3D.
I plan on uploading this to Itch.io at some point.
Currently only features one song, and the timing of beats for that song is only approximated.
